# 🗓️ Appointment UI Design

Hi there! 👋  
This is a clean and responsive web-based appointment form built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and the **AdminLTE** dashboard framework.

It was developed as part of my internship at **Fidrox Technologies**, where I was assigned a frontend task to implement a tabbed layout UI for booking appointments.
